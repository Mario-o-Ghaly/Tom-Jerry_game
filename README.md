# Tom&Jerry_maze
## Overview
This is a basic graph-based Tom and Jerry PC board game implemented in c++ programming language on QT GUI. This game was implemented as a project for an object oriented programming academic course at the American University in Cairo.

## Game Mechanics
Your character is "Jerry", and the objective is to bring 4 cheese pieces distributed at each corner of the game map into Jerry's 4 house holes: one cheese piece at each hole. Once you put all pieces at all holes, you win. While trying to do so, the AI-controlled villain character "Tom" chases you all the time, and if he catches you, you lose one life. You have 3 lives, when wasted, the game is over and you will have to start from the beginning. 

Use the arrow keys to move Jerry left, right, upward, or downward. 

There are also 2 power pellets that, when collected, allow you to enter power mode and become immune to Tom's pursuit. In addition, there are 2 portals located on opposite sides of the maze that can instantly teleport you to the other side.
