# Tom&Jerry_maze
## Overview
This is a basic graph-based Tom and Jerry PC board game implemented in c++ programming language on QT GUI. This game was implemented as a project for an object oriented programming academic course at the American University in Cairo.

## Game Mechanics
Your character is "Jerry", and the objective is to bring 4 cheese pieces distributed at each corner of the game map into Jerry's 4 house holes: one cheese piece at each hole. Once you put all pieces at all holes, you win. While trying to do so, the AI-controlled villain character "Tom" chases you all the time, and if he catches you, you lose one life. You have 3 lives, when wasted, the game is over and you will have to start from the beginning. 
Use the arrow keys to move "Jerry" left, right, upward, or downward. 
There are also 2 power pellets that, when collected, allow you to enter power mode and become immune to Tom's pursuit. In addition, there are 2 portals located on opposite sides of the maze that can instantly teleport you to the other side.

# Frogger Arcade Game
## Summary
Frogger Arcade game is a slight cariation of the classic Frogger Arcade Game developed by Konami. I made this game as a project that is part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. 

## How to play the game
 When you reach the water, you win the game and the game will start over. If you run into an enemy bug, you will die and the game will start over. THe enemy bugs are running across the screen at random locations and random speeds.

## Front-end Nanodegree guide to this project

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
